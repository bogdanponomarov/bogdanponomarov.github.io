## Trip wires

A piece of something (product, content) you don’t feel comfortable buying, but the price is very safe. You aren’t ready to buy a car, but you’ll pay 2 dollars to take it for a test drive.

It’s providing a small piece of your product away, or very affordably for customer to taste the value of the product/service you provide.


## Buyer Personas (client avatar/ideal client that you want to have in your business)

* Who are your buyers?
* What do they want?
* What is their motivation to buy your product? (Dig deeper to find their real motivation (a single mother wants to provide for her kids).)
* What are their pain points? (The problem that they have and the unique solution that you can provide for them)
* What do they do?
* When are they online?
* Why would they buy your product?
* Where would they go to research and find out more?
* Where do they live?
* What is their income level?
* What is their schedule like?
* Do they have a family?
