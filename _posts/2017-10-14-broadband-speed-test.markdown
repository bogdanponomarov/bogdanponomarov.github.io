# How to Get The Broadband Speed You Actually Pay For?

You might be paying your ISP for a certain internet plan, but have no idea whether you get the broadband speed you actually pay for. The best way to find out is to test it yourself.

If you are anything like us, kiwis find it difficult to trust new services and start using new products. But believe us, when it comes to checking our internet speed, we go to [Broadband Speed Check](http://broadbandspeedcheck.co.nz/). This broadband speed tester will measure the upload and download speeds of your internet connection in a couple of clicks.

For the most accurate broadband speed test results, close all the applications and windows, and connect to your wireless router by a WIRED connection, i.e. via an ethernet cable into the router. This will provide an accurate result of the internet speed coming into your home.

*We choose BroadbandSpeedCheck.co.nz because they are:*

* Powered by the global leader in internet performance testing and metrics - Ookla Speedtest
* Made by folks in New Zealand
* Shows the most accurate results of your actual internet speed

Keep in mind that if you pay for, let's say, a 100 Mbps connection, and you are getting 34 Mbps using the speed test, then you can audit your connection from ISP. If they toggled you at a slower speed by mistake, then they should give you what you paid for, or credit you back fees.

Not satisfied with your broadband speed test results? Maybe it's time to make ISP switching decision. Just contact us at [info@compareinternetplans.co.nz](mailto:"info@compareinternetplans.co.nz") or give us a call on 0508 662227
