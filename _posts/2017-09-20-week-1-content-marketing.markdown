# Week 1

Permission marketing
Inbound marketing
Providing Value

The foundation for all the other courses during the year.

REASONS for doing content marketing:

**Broadcast Marketing is dying**

Billboard (shotgun marketing). Here is the product, I’m just broadcasting it. I don’t care if you are interested in a product, I just show it to your face.

Rather, you want to speak to customers’ needs, not yours. Add value, not instructions. Give me relevance, not generic statements. Talk to me, not at me.

**Generates more Leads**

Can take time but it drives higher conversion rates.

Cheaper than traditional marketing. It can be cost effective.

**Brand Recall & Loyalty**

Can lead to advocacy (word of mouth, evangelist, ambassador). This is the holy grail of content marketing,

Keep and retain customers, and keep them coming. Attention span is low, so needs to keep the brand fresh. Increases reach.

**Creates demand**

Product / Service consideration (aware of your product and they gonna consider it).

Potential leads and sales

**Beginning of a relationship**

Builds trust

Less customer acquisition cost (how much time, effort and money it takes to attract clients).

The story of Content: Rise of the New Marketing - Trailer (Youtube)

Everybody can replicate your product. Nobody can replicate your Unique Point of View.

ROL - Return of Love. Authenticity.

## Content marketing’s purpose

is to attract and retain customers by consistently creating and curating (collecting content from other brands, and marketing it for my customers) relevant and valuable content with the intention of changing or enhancing consumer behaviour. It is an ongoing process (if you love change, and adaptation) that is best integrated into your overall marketing strategy, and it focuses on owning media, not renting it.

## Traditional Buyer’s Journey: AIDA

* Attention (salespeople would introduce prospects to products)
* Interest (present product)
* Desire (convince why you need it)
* Action (attempt to close prospects)

Modern buyer's journey: when you create content, the foundation is the buyer personas

1. Stimulus —> Awareness: TRIGGER that moves your customer to the next stage (click and follow the link/banner)/
2. Zero Moment of Truth —> Social Discovery TRIGGER free trails 7 days, 30 days/educational content through various channels (FB, email, etc.)
Lead magnet. Ebook, PDF/something for you to start sinking into the content.
     3.First Moment of Truth —> Consideration to Purchase (discounts, offers, free trials, coupons, comparisons). It’s customers’ motivation needs
If the online purchase is marriage, then the zero moment of truth is the first date. Here comes the transformation of your relationships. Here you transform leads into customers.
————————— BUY —————————
4. Second Moment of Truth —> Experience (certain campaigns, competitions, how-tos, seminars, updates, feedback, surveys)
5. Ultimate Moment of Truth —> Shared Experience (advocacy, shared experience, ambassadors, evangelists). Re-sharing what you shared by happy customers.

As marketers, you need to take customers through all of the stages equally well.

Placing the RIGHT CONTENT is going to make all the difference. But first, you need to know what your journey is. The following steps will be: knowing you platforms, persona, producing the content at the right time.
