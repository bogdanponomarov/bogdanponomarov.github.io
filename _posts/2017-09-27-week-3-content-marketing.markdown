## Connect Buyer’s Persona & Buyer’s Journey

* What type of content would each buyer persona best respond to?

At the end of the day, you gotta measure everything, otherwise it is pointless to even bother pursuing digital marketing.

Choose your business for the assessment: planetsuperheroes

* What type of content would work best for at each stage of the buyer journey?

Content Marketing Lifecycle

Strategise —> Plan —> Produce —> Promote —> Analyse (what’s working & what’s not) —> Amplify (more reach with what works) <—>

Strategy

* Why are you creating the content and what value will it provide?
* Who are you creating content for and how will benefit?
* What ideas and message you want to communicate? (Don’t just create content for no reason, have the company spirit/story)
* How will you structure your content plan and distribute it?
* How will you measure if it’s working or not?

Plan

* Types of Content (pieces of content relevant for your buyer’s persona)
* Distribution Channels (FB, IG, LinkedIn, etc.)
* Schedule
* Repurpose content (take text and turn it into video or something)
* Brainstorm ideas
* Budget

Produce
(consistency is key; are you allow to swear, colours, etc.)
* Research
* Style or Branding Guide
* In-house or Outsource
* Draft
* Revise
* Final Sign Off
* Publish
* Call to Action (when you produce content, you must be sure of what is the goal/what do you want people to do?)

Promote

* Social Media Channels
* Website
* Email
* Contests
* Advertisements
* Offline Events

Analyse

* Website Traffic — Unique and returning
* * Engagement — shares & comments
* Sign ups / Subscriptions
* * Consumption % (only watch 10 seconds of your 2 minute video, etc.)
* Leads & Sales $$$ (what piece of content made that sale)

Amplify
(only your best or high performing content)
* Repurpose content
* Influencers
* Republish on content distribution channels (Flipboard, Medium, LinkedIn, Mashable, etc.)
* Share on Communities
* Guest Blogging
* Re-marketing
* Amplification Tools / Service

Activity
Mock Business / List 3 goals which you might set yourself / to achieve each objective

Storyline = Overall Message/Idea that you want to communicate to your audience

“Patagonia gear is built to last and to be there, time and time again, as we adventure throughout our lives.”

Always #likeagirl

Being a girl is always seen as a negative thing, but this should never be the case.

Tips on Storyline: Make sure that your message doesn’t need any further explanations.

Elements of a Storyline:

Expertise - company is the expert on the topic
Strong Opinion - company is passionate about
Point of Sharing - resonates with your target market that will spark a conversation

Channels plan

Where will your audience be at each stage of the buyer journey?

* What is the goal of this channel? (Why are you using this channel, and for what stage?)
                FB — Awareness stage
                Email — …
                Website — Conversions
* What is the desired action? (Press/Click/Sign Up/Convert)
* What is the specific type of content the audience wants to get in this channel? (Direct people to the right channel for a certain purpose)
* What is the right tone for this channel?

You do NOT need to be in all the channels. Pick one, and start from there. You don’t necessarily need to be on some channels just because others are there. Decide the ones that work for your business.
